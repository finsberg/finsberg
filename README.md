I'm **Henrik Finsberg**, a Senior Research Engineer working at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no) in department of [Computational Physiology](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/department-computational-physiology) in Oslo, NorwayðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´.

I care about reproducibility and good software design. I work primarily with Python but also do some work with JavaScript, C and C++.
Recently, I am also trying to pick up Rust.

I work actively on creating tools and guidelines for reproducible research software in the section for scientific computing

A few open source projects I work on
- [ap_features](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/ap_features) - *Library for computing features for action potential traces*
- [mps](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/mps) - *Tool for working with cardiac MPS data*
- [mps-motion](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/mps-motion) - *Motion tracking software for cardiac MPS data*
- [gotran](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/gotran) - *Library for declaring and translating ODEs*
- [goss](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/goss) - *General ODE system solver*

I am also an active user of FEniCS and are working on adopting several of my packages to FEniCSx including
- [simcardems](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/simcardems) - *Simula Cardiac ElectroMechanics Solver* (FEniCSx version is coming in the future)
- [pulse](https://github.com/finsberg/pulse) and [pulsex](https://github.com/finsberg/pulsex) - *Simulation software for cardiac mechanics*
- [fenics-plotly](https://github.com/finsberg/fenics-plotly) and [fenicsx-plotly](https://github.com/finsberg/fenics-plotly) *Library for plotting object with plotly*
- [ldrb](https://github.com/finsberg/ldrb) - *Library for creating rule-based fiber orientations* (FEniCSx version is coming in the future)
